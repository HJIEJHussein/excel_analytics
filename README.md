### Project Overview

In this project, weâ€™ll investigate access to safe and affordable drinking water focussing on inequalities in services levels between different countries and regions.

### Data source 

The primary dataset used for this analysis is the CSV file estimates use of water in 2020 provided data from the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for water supply, sanitation, and hygiene (JMP). 
[https://github.com/HJIEJHussein/excel_analytics/blob/main/Estimates%20on%20the%20use%20of%20water%20(2020).csv]

### Tools

- Googlesheets : Data cleaning and analysis |https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sJNXuh-VJF-DlMuQn7fDALx6mCFMx2RhQ5losO_nBoY/edit?usp=sharing]

### Exploratory Data Analysis

- How do the world population estimates compare to the provided dataset populations?
- How does the urban population share compare to the rural population?
- How do these measures of water access compare across different types of areas?
- What does the national access to water look like based on national population size?
- What does the urban access to water look like based on urban population size?
- What does the rural access look like  on urban population size ?
- What is the effect of national population size and urbanisation on GNI and water access?

### Data Analysis

- Used Googlesheets to analyze the data

### Findings

-  The population number of the dataset in 2020 is 7.786 billions compared to 7.821 billions in the official statistics making it only 0.44 % of deviation
-  There is no obvious relationship between the volume of the population size and the rural and urban share

-  It seems that most of people have acces to basic water services on a national level, the urban areas have more access to basic water services compared to rural areas that counts more on the limited, unimproved 
   and surface services

-  it seems that the bigger the population size, the percentage of people having access to basic water services is bigger

-  The more a city is urbanised the more it has access to basic water

-  The more a city is ruralised the less it has access to basic water

-  As urbanisation increases, so does the share of the population with basic water access, and as GNI increases, limited, unimproved, and surface water access decreases.
-  More people included in this dataset live in lower-middle-income countries than in any of the other types of economies.
