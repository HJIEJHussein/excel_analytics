### Project Overview

In this project, weâ€™ll investigate access to safe and affordable drinking water focussing on inequalities in services levels between different countries and regions.

### Data source 

The primary dataset used for this analysis is the CSV file estimates use of water in 2020 provided data from the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for water supply, sanitation, and hygiene (JMP). 
[https://github.com/HJIEJHussein/excel_analytics/blob/main/Estimates%20on%20the%20use%20of%20water%20(2020).csv]

### Tools

- Googlesheets : Data cleaning and analysis |https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sJNXuh-VJF-DlMuQn7fDALx6mCFMx2RhQ5losO_nBoY/edit?usp=sharing]

### Exploratory Data Analysis

- How do the world population estimates compare to the provided dataset populations?
- How does the urban population share compare to the rural population?
- How do these measures of water access compare across different types of areas?
- What does the national access to water look like based on national population size?
- What does the urban access to water look like based on urban population size?
- What does the rural access look like  on urban population size ?
- What is the effect of national population size and urbanisation on GNI and water access?

### Data Analysis

- Used Googlesheets to analyze the data

### Findings

-  The population number of the dataset in 2020 is 7.786 billions compared to 7.821 billions in the official statistics making it only 0.44 % of deviation
-  There is no obvious relationship between the volume of the population size and the rural and urban share

-  It seems that most of people have acces to basic water services on a national level, the urban areas have more access to basic water services compared to rural areas that counts more on the limited, unimproved 
   and surface services

-  31% of our population has water infrastructure in their homes

-  45% face non-functional systems due to issues with pipes, pumps, and reservoirs. Towns like Amina, the rural parts of Amanzi, and a couple
   of towns across Akatsi and Hawassa have broken infrastructure.

-  18% of our people are using wells of which, but within that, only 28% are clean. These are mostly in Sokoto, Kilimani and Akatsi.

-  Our citizens often face long wait times for water, averaging more than 120 minutes

-  Queues are very long on Saturdays and Wednesdays and Sundays have the shortest queues

-  Queues are longer in the mornings and evenings.
